## Symposium Announcement: Justice, Power, and Control in Medical AI

As part of the 3rd International Conference on Decision Making in Medicine and Law: Opportunities and pitfalls of information technologies[(DMM&L 2025)](https://eascitech.eu.org/dmm%26l/2025/) conference, we are happy to announce the symposium 'Justice, Power, and Control in Medical AI', which will take place on Friday,12.12, from 11:20.

DMM&L 2025 aims at bringing together forensic psychiatrists and psychologists, legal experts, researchers and research scholars to exchange and share their experiences and research results on all aspects of decision making in medicine and law, with a special emphasis on the implications of the use of information technologies.

-  MHC over AI for health: patient testimony and epistemic privilege – Patrik Hummel (University of Lucerne)
-  Epistemic justice as an enabler of meaningful human control over medical AI – Giorgia Pozzi (TU Delft) & Filippo Santoni de Sio (TU Eindhoven, ECPAI Member)
-  Moderator AI: strengthening patient participation in clinical decision-making – Banu Buruk, Sanaa Abrahams, Simon Fischer, Giulio Mecacci (Radboud University)
-  Moral deskilling in forensic psychiatry through use of artificial intelligence – Anco Peeters (Radboud University)
