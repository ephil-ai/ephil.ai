summary: ""

abstract: "In this talk I defend the position of the centrality of the trusted doctor in medical ethics, including ethics of psychiatric medicine. Psychiatric medicine faces a series of distinct ethical challenges, associated with the nature of their specialty, their powers (legal and ethical), provider-patient relationship (such as involuntary commitment, risk of stigmatization), and challenges to the field (lack of biomarkers, disability rights movements), etc. The introduction of AI in psychiatric medicine raises unique ethical problems and puts a sharper point on existing ethical challenges regarding introducing AI in medicine, while maintaining physician-patient trust."
