## Creativity & Generative AI: Philosophical Perspectives on Creative Uses of Artificial Intelligence

“I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing. Not for AI to do my art and writing, so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” Joanna Maciejewska’s widely shared quote captures a growing unease about AI’s impact on human creativity. As generative AI systems increasingly produce images, music, and texts with remarkable fluency, they raise profound philosophical and ethical questions: What makes creativity uniquely human? Should AI’s creative outputs be taken seriously? And what might these systems reveal about the nature of our own creative processes? 

This five-day OZSW course, organized by Dr. Matthew Dennis at Eindhoven University of Technology, explores how generative AI is reshaping our concept of creativity and its role in society. Through lectures, discussions, and encounters with AI practitioners such as Iyad Rahwan and Helena Nikonole, participants will examine how philosophy can illuminate the promises and challenges of AI in the arts, education, and research. The course will take place on January 22, 2025, at TU Eindhoven Campus, offering 5 ECTS for active participation and a short written assignment. More information can be [found here](https://www.ozsw.nl/activity/creativity-generative-ai-philosophical-perspectives-on-creative-uses-of-artificial-intelligence-2/  ).

ECPAI members Carlos Zednik, lecturer Philip Nickel and Filippo Santoni de Sio will be among the team of lecturers.
