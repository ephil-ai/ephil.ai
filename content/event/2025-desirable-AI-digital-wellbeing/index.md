## Seminar on Digital Well-Being

As part of the ongoing seminar **"Cross-Cultural Approaches to Desirable AI"**, we are pleased to announce the digital well-being session, which will take place on 11 December 2025.

The series aims to encourage intercultural and interdisciplinary discussion on the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI). Its primary focus is to support and develop research on AI and social justice, particularly from intersectional feminist and anti-racist perspectives.

The seminar on digital well-being features three excellent talks:
- Dr. Mamun Rashid (SYNC, Ithra): Offline Is the New Luxury? Exploring the Right to Disconnect - Connect.
- Matthew J. Dennis (TU Eindhoven, ECPAI Member): Who is Responsible for Digital Well-Being?
- Julia Maria Mönig (CST, Uni Bonn): The luxury of digital well-being: privacy as privilege.
