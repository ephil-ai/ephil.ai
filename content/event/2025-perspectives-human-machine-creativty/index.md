## What does it mean to be creative in the age of generative AI? 

In collaboration with Iyad Rahawan and Yvonne Bialek, ECPAI Co-Director Matthew Dennis co-organized the conference ‘Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Human and Machine Creativity’ at the Max-Planck-Institut für Bildungsforschung in Berlin. Over the course of three days, this event brought together researchers from behavioural and computer science, philosophy and ethics, arts, communication, and media studies. The event created space to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and envision new directions for understanding how both humans and machines shape creative expression 
 
The program featured short presentations, moderated panel discussions, and opportunities for cross-disciplinary conversation. Beyond the formal sessions, participants were invited to take part in afternoon and evening visits to the Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art and other art events, bridging research with cultural practice in meaningful ways. 

This included, among others, a keynote by Iyad Rahwan, exploring how artificial intelligence is forging a new sphere of cultural expression that transcends traditional boundaries. Annette Zimmermann highlighted the political philosophy of AI, stressing the labor exploitation & oligarchic concentrations of power in the AI space. ECPAI member Filippo Santoni de Sio spoke about AI and the Politics of Aesthetics, analyzing to what extent AI can improve our democratic skills, or rather create “political deskilling”.  

These are just some highlights of the diverse and thought-provoking program. To see the full agenda, visit the [event page ](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/chm/conferences/summerschool)
