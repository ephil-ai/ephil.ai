## Toward a systemic concept of attention for the attention economy using Buddhist and Western ethics

In a recently published article “[Attention as Practice](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=pJCS1VwAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=pJCS1VwAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC)” we argue that the current critiques of the attention economy are too narrow. We plea for a broader and more systemic concept of attention to propose changes to the attention economy.

As a next step, we want to use “Western” and Buddhist approaches to analyze and discuss with you what this broader systemic concept of attention could look like.

We therefore invite you to a hybrid event. The in-person meeting will take place at the [TU/e campus](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tu+eindhoven&t=newext&atb=v325-1&ia=web&iaxm=maps&iax=images) at walking distance from Eindhoven central station.
