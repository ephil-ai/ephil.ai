Hybrid workshop on the philosophy of large language models (with a focus on communication and explainable AI). Hosted and sponsored by the [Eindhoven Center for the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence](https://ephil.ai) ([@ephil.ai](https://twitter.com/ephil_ai)), the research consortium [Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies (ESDIT)](https://www.esdit.nl), and the [Philosophy and Ethics Group](https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/philosophy-ethics) at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/) ([@PhilEthicsTuE](https://twitter.com/PhilEthicsTUe)).

In this workshop, we explore two aspects of the nature of large language models like LaMDA, GPT3 or PaLM. On the first day, we will explore the question of what it can mean for these LLMs to make speech acts or to communicate with us. What can it mean for a chatbot to make an assertion or make a demand? 
On the second day, we will discuss LLMs in relation to explainable AI. How can we make sense of the transformer models that make modern LLMs so successful?
The workshop is a hybrid event and open to anyone who is interested. It will take place at the end of January, most likely either January 25th and 26th, or January 26th and 27th.
