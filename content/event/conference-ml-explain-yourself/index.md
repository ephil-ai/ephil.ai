*ML, Explain Yourself!* is a 3-day conference in Utrecht, the Netherlands, organized by the Normative Philosophy of Science Lab at Utrecht University and Eindhoven University of Technology. It is the capstone conference for the [Dutch Research Council](https://www.nwo.nl/en) Veni project: *Explain yourself!? The scope of understanding and explanation from machine learning*. The conference will bring together philosophers and computer science researchers to discuss issues in machine learning surrounding decision support, scientific discovery, generalization, explanation, idealization, reliability, values, trust, and other areas in normative philosophy of science.
