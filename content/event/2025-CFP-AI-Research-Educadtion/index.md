We are pleased to announce the Call for Papers for the AI in Research & Education unit, part of the Oxford Intersections: AI & Society series published by Oxford University Press. The section is co-edited by Dr. Vlasta Sikimić and Dr. Matthew J. Dennis (Eindhoven University of Technology), under the general editorship of Prof. Philipp Hacker. This unit invites contributions examining how AI-enabled research and education are transforming our understandings of creativity, trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. 

Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the ways we learn, teach, and produce knowledge. We welcome philosophical and interdisciplinary papers that address the ethical and epistemic dimensions of these transformations, including questions of fairness, authorship, bias, and epistemic trust in AI-supported environments. 
 Abstracts (up to 400 words) are due November 15, 2025, and full papers (6,000–8,000 words) by May 31, 2026. 
 More information and submission details [can be found here! ](https://philevents.org/event/show/140246 )
