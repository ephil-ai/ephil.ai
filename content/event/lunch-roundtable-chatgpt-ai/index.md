## How can learning objectives, activities, and assessment be redesigned in the context of generative AI systems such as ChatGPT?

Join the Academy for Learning and Teaching (ALT) as we kick off a series of lunch roundtables on ChatGPT and AI, starting with **Constructive alignment in the age of generative AI**, a workshop on 1st November 2023, from 12:00 to 13:20, at Atlas 6.208.

Leading the first roundtable are [Carlos Zednik](http://explanations.ai) and [Gunter Bombaerts](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/gunter-bombaerts/), assistant professors at Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences. Their roundtable serves as an invitation to discuss the following questions:

- Which knowledge will students need to possess in a 21st century work environment?
- Which skills will they need to acquire, and which skills can be increasingly off-loaded to the machines?
- How can learning activities incorporate generative AI as a supportive tool?
- How can assessment be in line with the previous two questions?

A brief introductory presentation will be followed by discipline-specific breakout meetings to identify suitable learning objectives in the age of generative AI, and to brainstorm about corresponding learning activities and assessment methods. A plenary discussion will follow.

The event is open to teachers and support staff. Registration is free but limited, so secure your slot at https://bit.ly/LunchRoundtable011123. Complimentary food and beverages catering to different dietary options are available.
