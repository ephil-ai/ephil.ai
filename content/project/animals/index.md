This cluster takes as its focus the philosophical and ethical relationships between non-humananimals, AI, and other intelligent systems. Animal and artificial intelligence both exhibitproblem-solving abilities, learning capacities, and adaptive behaviors, via variousmechanisms. Animal intelligence often involves complex social interactions andenvironmental adaptations. It is sometimes specific to a niche, and sometimes generalizedand adaptive, evolving over time. While animal intelligence is rooted in biological evolution,AI is a product of human design and programming. Philosophically, the comparison betweenthese systems raises important questions about the nature of intelligence and cognition.

The cluster also addresses ethical considerations regarding the moral status of both kinds ofentities. The cognitive abilities of non-human animals warrant certain rights and protections,reflecting their capacity for suffering and emotional experiences. This moral considerationcould potentially extend to AI or hybrid animal-AI intelligences, especially as such systemsbecome more sophisticated. Philosophically, the treatment of animals has sometimes beenused as a model for thinking about how humans can, or should, relate to AI.

Another important group of ethical issues concerns the relationships and interactionsbetween animals and AI. For example, AI could be used in animal husbandry or animalresearch to monitor and influence agricultural production, waste production, well-being, orother factors. Animal-AI hybrids, AI-enhancement of animals, or AI-animal organoids could becreated for research purposes. AI can be used as part of non-animal models for conductingpharmaceutical and medical research, in the hope of reducing exploitation of animals.

## KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS
- In what ways is animal intelligence similar to artificial intelligence?
- Are there connections between the moral status of animals and animal intelligence, and that of artificial intelligence?
- Do AI-animal hybrids raise particular philosophical or ethical questions?
- What is the future of AI-animal interaction, and what philosophical and ethical issues does it raise?

## Activities
Co-sponsor and contribute to activities in the Europe Horizon project NAP4DIVE, investigating AI- and organ-on-a-chip non-animal models for medical research (e.g. workshops, tracks at conferences).

## Members
- Patrik Hummel, Assistant Professor, P&E
- Philip J. Nickel, Associate Professor, P&E
- Diego Morales PÃ©rez, PhD candidate, P&E
