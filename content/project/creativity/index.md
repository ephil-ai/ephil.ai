Creativity has been viewed as a distinctive feature of human beings, as well as considered to be closely connected to their well-being. Many designers, engineers, and artists argue that being creative is a vital dimension of their practical lives, one that is also key for their self-understanding and identity formation. Even those who are not creative professionals often report that creative activity is an important part of their selfcare and maintenance of their well-being. The creativity cluster will investigate how AI changes the connection between creativity and well-being. We will investigate the nature and value of creativity for humans, as well as what happens when AI is used to replace or supplement creative activities. In addition to exploring the connection of creativity to well-being, the cluster will pay special attention to the ethics of using AI creatively, including issues relating to plagiarism, intentionality, deskilling, accountability, and signification.
