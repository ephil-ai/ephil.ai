Creativity has been viewed as a distinctive feature of human beings, as well asconsidered to be closely connected to their well-being. Many designers, engineers, andartists argue that being creative is a vital dimension of their practical lives, one that isalso key for their self-understanding and identity formation. Even those who are notcreative professionals often report that creative activity is an important part of their selfcareand maintenance of their well-being. The creativity cluster will investigate how AIchanges the connection between creativity and well-being. We will investigate the natureand value of creativity for humans, as well as what happens when AI is used to replace orsupplement creative activities. In addition to exploring the connection of creativity towell-being, the cluster will pay special attention to the ethics of using AI creatively,including issues relating to plagiarism, intentionality, deskilling, accountability, andsignification.

## Research Questions
