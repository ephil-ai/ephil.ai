[Professor Cameron Buckner](http://cameronbuckner.net/professional/index.htm) will assume the position of visiting fellow at the Eindhoven Center for the Philosophy of AI (ECPAI) during the period of 17th June 2024 to 5th July 2024.

Buckner is one of the leading philosophical voices on theoretical issues in artificial intelligence generally and deep learning specifically. His research centers on the question of whether and to what extent data-driven neural networks can be considered rational agents, appealing to philosophical and psychological conceptions of rationality as well as to the engineering details of deep neural networks and transformer models. Buckner's research focus and interdisciplinary training would complement the existing strengths of the [Philosophy & Ethics group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/innovation-sciences/philosophy-ethics) and Eindhoven Center for Philosophy of AI, while allowing him to actively contribute with several AI research groups at the departments of [Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/industrial-engineering-and-innovation-sciences), [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science), and [Electrical Engineering](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/electrical-engineering)

Buckner will deliver a research talk at the Philosophy & Ethics and Eindhoven Center for Philosophy of AI seminar on several chapters of his [book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/from-deep-learning-to-rational-machines-9780197653302), each of which focuses on empiricist theorizing about a particular mental faculty and how modeling them using deep neural network modules can help bootstrap models to greater degrees of rational flexibility.

Moreover, he will lead a masterclass for graduate students and postdocs on philosophical issues at the cutting edge of deep learning research.

Finally, Buckner will give a lecture at the [Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/institutes/eindhoven-artificial-intelligence-systems-institute).
