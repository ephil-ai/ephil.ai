We are pleased to congratulate our colleague **Céline Budding** for successfully completing her PhD thesis, _“What do language models know when they know language? A theoretical framework for explaining the linguistic behavior of LLMs”_. 

Céline’s research investigates **what kind of knowledge large language models may possess** and lays out a theoretical framework for examining what large language models really learn from the enormous amounts of data they’re trained on. Specifically, she motivates in her dissertation  a cognitivist approach towards explaining the behavior of LLMs and provides a framework for explaining the linguistic behavior of LLMs through the identification of tacit knowledge in these systems. 

Supervised within the Eindhoven University of Technology by **Carlos Zednik** and **Vincent Müller**, Céline’s dissertation offers an important contribution to the philosophy of AI and provides a rigorous foundation for future research into how language models possess knowledge.
