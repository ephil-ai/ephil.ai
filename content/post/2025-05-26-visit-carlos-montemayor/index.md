[Professor Carlos Montemayor](https://philosophy.sfsu.edu/people/carlos-montemayor) (San Francisco State University) will assume the position of visiting fellow at the Eindhoven Center for the Philosophy of AI (ECPAI) during the period of 26th May 2025 to 6th June 2025.

With a background in Law, Philosophy, and Cognitive Science, Montemayor conducts highly interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Legal Epistemology, Philosophy of Mind, Cognitive Psychology, and Artificial Intelligence. His recent work explores the notions and prospects of AI consciousness and agency. In his latest book, _The Prospect of a Humanitarian Artificial Intelligence_, he integrates insights from these topics to offer a comprehensive analysis of the alignment problem in AI from both epistemic and ethical perspectives.

As a Visiting Professor within the Eindhoven AI Systems Institute, Montemayor will give a lecture on 3rd June on the topic of [Varieties of AI Alignment](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/calendar-and-events/03-06-2025-eaisi-lecture-by-visiting-professor-carlos-montemayor).
