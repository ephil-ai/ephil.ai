Our ECPAI Co-Director, Matthew Dennis, will be a visiting professor at the University of Florence in November 2025. During his visit, Matthew will present three talks:  

- Does Creative Artificial Intelligence Threaten Human Well-Being?
- Philosophising Post-ChatGPT: New Philosophical Methods & Processes
- Understanding the Question: ‘What is Contemporary about Contemporary Life?’ 

The visiting professorship presents an ideal opportunity for advancing cross-disciplinary collaboration and scholarly exchange. It will allow for the cultivation of innovative ideas, the strengthening of academic partnerships, and engaging in lively exchanges that spark new ideas and approaches.
