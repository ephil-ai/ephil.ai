Dr. Lily Eva Frank is a Philosopher and an Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Ethics at Eindhoven University of Technology, in the Netherlands. Her research interests are broad and include the ethics of social robotics (including chat-bots, sex robots, and care robots); the ethics of AI in medicine, especially issues regarding the disruption of the physician-patient relationship, AI in psychiatry and psychology, and impacts on vulnerable groups; and the ethical issues and disruptions that arise when AI meets behaviour change and persuasive technology.
