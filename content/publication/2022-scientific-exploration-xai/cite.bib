  abstract = {Models developed using machine learning are increasingly prevalent in scientific research. At the same time, these models are notoriously opaque. Explainable AI aims to mitigate the impact of opacity by rendering opaque models transparent. More than being just the solution to a problem, however, Explainable AI can also play an invaluable role in scientific exploration. This paper describes how post-hoc analytic techniques from Explainable AI can be used to refine target phenomena in medical science, to identify starting points for future investigations of (potentially) causal relationships, and to generate possible explanations of target phenomena in cognitive science. In this way, this paper describes how Explainable AI\textemdash over and above machine learning itself\textemdash contributes to the efficiency and scope of data-driven scientific research.}
