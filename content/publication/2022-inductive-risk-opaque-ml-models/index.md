abstract: Under what conditions does machine learning (ML) model opacity inhibit the possibility of explaining and understanding phenomena? In this paper, I argue that non-epistemic values give shape to the ML opacity problem even if we keep researcher interests fixed. Treating ML models as an instance of doing model-based science to explain and understand phenomena reveals that there is (i) an *external* opacity problem, where the presence of inductive risk imposes higher standards on externally validating models, and (ii) an *internal* opacity problem, where greater inductive risk demands a higher level of transparency regarding the inferences the model makes.
