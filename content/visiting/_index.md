The Eindhoven Center for the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence brings visiting fellows to Eindhoven, physically and virtually. Visiting fellows collaborate with members of the Center to explore philosophical and ethical topics in artificial intelligence, with the aim of producing academic research and supporting the development of responsible and innovative AI. Visiting fellows may come from academic institutions or the AI industry. During their tenure, fellows are invited to join research groups, give lectures, co-organize workshops, co-author academic papers and/or jointly work on novel AI methods and documentation.

We [welcome inquiries](/#contact) about fellowship opportunities for AI industry representatives, preferably mentioning concrete project ideas for which philosophical collaboration is essential. For academics, we will release more details about the fellowship program during the 2022-2023 academic year. There is a limited budget available to support travel and lodging, but we also welcome fellows with separate funding.
