The Eindhoven Center for the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence brings visiting fellows to Eindhoven physically and digitally. Visiting fellows collaborate with researchers in the Philosophy & Ethics group to explore philosophical topics in artificial intelligence. Among others, they join research groups, give lectures and co-organize workshops, and co-author academic papers.

If you are interested in joining ECPAI as a visiting fellow, [contact us](/contact)!
